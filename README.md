I needed a way to feed gcode line-by-line to GRBL on the Mac and I couldn't find what I was looking for so....I wrote GRBLFeeder!

Right now the app is very, very rough (in fact it usually crashes when running outside of the debugger).  However, in the spirit of sharing (and for the fact that I lost track of the code for awhile) I'm starting the repository now even though the code isn't quite ready for use by the general public.
